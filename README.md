# Unity-Projects
A small collection of prototypes made using the Unity game engine.

Note that because of Github's file upload restrictions, I can only upload these projects as .zip files. The scripts for all projects are written using C#.

## `2.5D FPN`
An early prototype for an RPG-like game with 2D sprites navigating a 3D environment. 2D assets are taken from the games Earthbound and Undertale. This build features 3D movement with character animations; interactable objects in the environment that are described using a dialogue box; colliders for the player, objects in the environment and room boundaries; collision boxes that detect when the player is behind an object to make that foreground object more transparent; a camera that follows the player within certain predefined boundaries; and scene transitions between different rooms.

## `2D FPN`
The precursor to the `2.5D FPN` project
