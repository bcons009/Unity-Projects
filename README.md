# Unity-Projects
A small collection of prototypes made using the Unity game engine.

Note that because of Github's file upload restrictions, I can only upload these projects as .zip and .7z files. The scripts for all projects are written using C#.

Video (.mp4) files showcasing each of these projects are available in the `video demos` directory.

## `2.5D FPN`
An early prototype for an RPG-like game with 2D sprites navigating a 3D environment. 2D assets are taken from the games Earthbound and Undertale. This build features 3D movement with character animations; interactable objects in the environment that are described using a dialogue box; colliders for the player, objects in the environment and room boundaries; collision boxes that detect when the player is behind an object to make that foreground object more transparent; a camera that follows the player within certain predefined boundaries; a custom 3D staircase model made using Blender and scene transitions between different rooms.
Developed between February and March 2020.

## `2D FPN`
The precursor to the `2.5D FPN` project, a prototype for a completely 2D RPG-like game with a top-down camera. While this project was not developed on as much as `2.5D FPN`, some notable developments that were still made on the project include colliders for the player, objects in the environment and room boundaries as well as interactable objects in the environment that are described using a dialogue box. If these two features sound very similar to features found in `2.5D FPN`, that is because the implementations of these features in `2D FPN` were carried over into `2.5D FPN`.
Developed in January 2020.

## `Tensei`
An attempt at a classic first-person RPG, similar to the early Shin Megami Tensei games. This project features more intricate and complex 3D models using Blender, as well as some simple texturing. Unfortunately at some point I seem to have broken the code controlling movement, and have not fixed it since. As it currently stands the project is an interesting toybox of ideas for an old-school RPG set in a school setting.
Developed between May and June 2018.
